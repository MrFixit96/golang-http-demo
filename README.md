# golang-http-demo
This is a simple golang app that generates api server and serves a front end using ace templates. I found and mashed together a couple different example tutorials out on the web and made a working thing to display why using Golang and Docker Scratch containers is awesome.

**-Note: When converting to Docker Container Format, it would make more sense to move the database to a persistent volume than compiling it into the container, but this is meant to be a simple demo.**
